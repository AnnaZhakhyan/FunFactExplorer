## AI Usage prompts and what we have learned
(write down and log all your promts to the AI tool and how it evolves over time, and how AI actually helped you)
workflow with the web development with AI tools with some example prompts and how they are used in different steps in web development 

### Prompts

#### 1. Help me decide on a topic for my HTML, CSS, JS website. Here are the requirements (requirements from prof).
   This prompt helps with the general decision regarding the topic of the website. We believe that AI can really help when it comes to creativity and idea generation. However, because the ideas are very broad, we combined some ideas and changed them to our liking.
#### 2. I want to make a fun fact explorer website in html and css, which structure for it would you suggest?
   This prompt asks ChatGPT about a more convenient structure for the website without directly asking it for specific code. This is convenient for the programmers because it provides standard based code and allows them to work on more specicifc features.
#### 3. Make this page better looking and feel more user-friendly please.
   We think one of the best things you can use AI for is web design, and this prompt is a great example of how it can help improve the process of web development by making working pages more adapted to users.
#### 4. Solving problems in the output. This output (..) has caused me problems, explain the error.
   After coding, there were problems occurring in the output of the program. We took a screenshot of the list of problems with the code on top of it and asked ChatGPT to tell us the exact problem. Because the problems are listed as codes, ChatGPT knows what the problem is and helps us to solve them. Through the help, we can focus on the specific features with an automatic error trail. 
   For example, the game on the Index-page had problems because I coded in Java first and then transferred it to Javascript. There were problems of some functions. ChatGPT explained the problem, so I was able to change the code accordingly without changing my features. 
#### 5. Help me integrate this AI chatbot into the index file as a pop-up widget.
   This prompt was essential for merging our standalone chatbot prototype into the main website. We had a functioning script to talk to the Gemini API, but we were unsure how to make it appear as a non-intrusive pop-up on the homepage. The AI acted as a front-end specialist, generating the specific CSS for the floating button and the JavaScript logic to toggle the window open and closed. This allowed us to successfully integrate a complex feature like an AI API without having to rewrite our entire website structure or struggle with CSS positioning.
#### 6. Adapt this page more to the others design-wise. 
This prompt focuses on design and scalability, we think that this kind of work is easier done through AI to ensure consistency.

### How AI usage evolved over time and how it helped us.
At the beginning of the project, our prompts were very broad and exploratory. We mostly relied on AI for brainstorming, structure planning, and general decision-making. For example, deciding on a topic or shaping the overall layout of the website were tasks where AI served mainly as a creative partner. We noticed that during this early stage, even simple prompts provided valuable guidance because we were still figuring out our direction.

As the project progressed, our prompts became progressively more specific, technical, and context-dependent. Instead of asking for “ideas,” we started asking for code-level explanations, error debugging, and integration strategies. This shift happened naturally as our understanding deepened and our questions became more targeted. Instead of asking the AI what to build, we asked how to build particular features.

By the middle of development, AI had become a powerful problem-solving tool. Whenever a JavaScript function didn’t work as expected or the browser console displayed cryptic error codes, we used the AI almost like a tutor. It helped interpret error messages, explain why certain functions behaved differently in JavaScript compared to Java, and even suggested more efficient approaches. This saved a significant amount of time and kept us moving forward instead of getting stuck on small technical obstacles.

In the design phase, our interaction with AI evolved again. We used it as a UI/UX consultant, asking it to refine layouts, improve visual consistency, or redesign entire sections to feel more professional and responsive. These prompts were often paired with screenshots of existing pages. The AI could quickly diagnose what felt unbalanced or unclear and provide CSS improvements that would’ve taken us much longer to figure out manually.

Towards the end of the project, AI became an integration assistant. When we merged the chatbot API into the index page, for example, we relied on the AI to translate a standalone script into a fully working pop-up widget. This required coordinating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—something that can be surprisingly time-consuming when done from scratch. The AI handled the boilerplate and interaction logic, leaving us free to focus on styling and user experience.

Overall, our use of AI evolved from:

Idea generation → Structure planning → Debugging → Feature integration → Design refinement

Each step became more focused as the project matured. AI didn’t replace our programming; it amplified it. It handled repetitive or confusing parts, explained errors that would have taken hours to research, and improved the visual quality of the final product.

Most importantly, by logging prompts and tracking how we used the AI, we noticed a clear pattern: the more context we provided, the more useful and accurate the responses became. This helped us learn to formulate better prompts, making AI an increasingly effective collaborator throughout the entire web development workflow.
